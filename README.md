# The Difference B/W MULTI-PROCESSING AND MULTI-THREADING

### BASIS FOR COMPARISON	MULTIPROCESSING	MULTITHREADING

#### ***Multiprocessiong:***

#####  Multiprocessing adds CPUs to increase computing power.Multiple processes are executed concurrently.Creation of a process is time-consuming and resource intensive.Multiprocessing can be symmetric or asymmetric.

#### ***Multithreading:***

#####  Multithreading creates multiple threads of a single process to increase computing power.Multiple threads of a single process are executed concurrently.Creation of a thread is economical in both sense time and resource.Multithreading is not classified.
