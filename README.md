# The Diiference B/W MULTI-PROCESSING AND MULTI-THREADING

### BASIS FOR COMPARISON	MULTIPROCESSING	MULTITHREADING

#### ***Multiprocessiong:***

#####  Multiprocessing adds CPUs to increase computing power.Multiple processes are executed concurrently.Creation of a process is time-consuming and resource intensive.Multiprocessing can be symmetric or asymmetric.
